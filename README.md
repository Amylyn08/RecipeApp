# FAQ
## Prabhjot Aulakh
How to restrict UI based on if a user is logged in or not ?

When should we create custom exceptions ?

## Amy
How should the user handle the price input? What kind of validation would we use? 0-100$ range? by category? 

How are we going to "categorize" foods? This is concerning the filtering feature. How are we going to get what the user wants with what they select? (Beef, chicken, pasta, no carbs..)

## Rida
How should the application handle not found recipes ?

Can the user create a recipe if he doesnt have all the requirements for making one ?
